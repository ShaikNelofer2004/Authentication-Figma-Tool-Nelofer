Authentication Flowchart Using Figma

This flowchart represents a basic user authentication process used in most login systems. It outlines the logical steps involved in verifying a userâ€™s identity based on their username and password.

How It Works:
1.	Start:
The process begins when a user attempts to log in to a system or application.
2.	Login Screen:
The user is presented with a login screen where they must enter their username and password.
3.	Click Submit:
Once the user fills in the credentials, they click on the submit/login button to proceed with authentication.
4.	Username Validation:
The system first checks whether the entered username exists in the database.
o	If the username is invalid, the system displays an "Invalid Username" error message, and the process ends there.
o	If the username is valid, the system proceeds to password verification.
5.	Password Validation:
The system then checks whether the provided password matches the one stored for that username.
o	If the password is incorrect, an "Incorrect Password" error message is shown.
o	If the password is correct, the user is successfully authenticated.
6.	Login Successful:
Upon successful username and password validation, the user gains access to the system or is redirected to their dashboard or homepage.

Outcome:
The flowchart ensures a secure, step-by-step validation process that protects user data by checking both the username and password before granting access.
